of this data, but some errors will inevitably creep in.  In other words, THE 
DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRO-FOOTBALL-REFERENCE DATABASE SHOULD IN NO WAY BE

Variables: ID, last name, first name, year, team, position, G, GS, COMP, ATT, PassYD,
PassTD, INT, rush, rushYD, rushTD, rec, recYD, recTD



NOTES:
1.  The last name, first name, and position may not always match the given 
players' entry in the master table.  I'm working on fixing this.  

2.  GS is not available for all entries.  If I didn't have it, I put down a
 zero.  So not all zeroes in that field are actually zeroes.

3.  Players who played for multiple teams in the same season will have a 
separate line for each team, and no total line for that season.  

4.  Team abbreviations are not always what you'd expect.  For example, Eddie 
George's team is "oti", which represents "Oilers/Titans" (the best I could 
do with 3 letters).
